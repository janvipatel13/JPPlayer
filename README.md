## DEPRECATED - This project is deprecated. I suggest you to look for alternatives like JPPlayer.


##### Features

* Completely written in __Kotlin__.
* __Based on the stock MediaPlayer API__ It will work on all devices and all CPUs, and it works with both local and remote sources.
* __Simple__ Much less code is required than alternative options to get up and running.
* __Very configurable__ There are lots of options available to make the player behave exactly how you want it to behave.
* __Swipe Gestures__ Supports the common on-screen scroll behavior which is used by MXPlayer, VLC and other Android video players.
* __Tap Gestures__ Double tap on right or left side of the screen to jump back and forward like Youtube and Netflix players.
